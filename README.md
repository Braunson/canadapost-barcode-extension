Problem Solved
--------------

The problem this solves it that the mobile app for Canada Post allows you to track numbers, get updates on statuses of packages, etc. It also allows you to scan a barcode but when you recieve a tracking number in your email or on a receipt, there's no barcode. So this way when you click the link to "track" your package in your email, when it opens the tracking page on the Canada Post website, a barcode is added which you can use their mobile app to scan it with and add the tracking number into the app!
